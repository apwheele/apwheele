### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Andy Wheeler. Currently a private sector data scientist working with health insurance claims (mostly statistical models to identify problematic health claims). Formerly though I was an academic (PhD in criminal justice), and [I mostly worked with police departments to evaluate crime reduction initiatives, and improve the efficiency and fairness of different predictive policing systems](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=iNNqtgwAAAAJ&hl=en). I often [blog on various data science/statistic projects](https://andrewpwheeler.com/) (in quite a few different languages). 

You can reach me at apwheele@gmail.com, or check out my consulting services at [**CRIME** De-Coder](https://crimede-coder.com/).
