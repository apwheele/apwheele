### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Andy Wheeler. Currently a data scientist at Gainwell working with health insurances claims (mostly statistical models to identify problematic health claims). Formerly though I was an academic (PhD in criminal justice), and [I mostly worked with police departments to evaluate crime reduction initiatives, and improve the efficient and fairness of different predictive policing systems](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=iNNqtgwAAAAJ&hl=en). I often [blog on various data science/statistic projects](https://andrewpwheeler.com/) (in quite a few different languages).
